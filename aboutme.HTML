    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src = "hike.jpg">
    <p class ="p">I am a sophomore at PHS in the Bay Area. I am 15 and enjoy swimming, hiking, and adventuring because I love being outdoors and exploring. I play basketball and football, and also enjoy playing video games. I have a sister named Teah who is a freshman in college in Ohio, but she comes back for summer.</p>
