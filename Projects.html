    <p class = "p">One academic project that I completed was a performance task for APCSP where I had to create a complex code. My code used the users input to find affordable locations for a trip based on their budget. Another academic project that I completed was the I-search project for my English class. I wrote about how climate change was affecting sea life and how we can work towards fixing it.</p>
